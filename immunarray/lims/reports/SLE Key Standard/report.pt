          The SLE-key® test utilizes ImmunArray’s proprietary iCHIP® technology of microarray printing of antigens on a small chip to identify patterns of
          autoantibodies signatures that are processed into actionable clinical data. Unlike other testing platforms that may aggregate individual test results
          from ELISA or other similar testing formats, the SLE-key® test compiles a computerized analysis of the test patterns as a whole, providing a profile
          of the immune system in its entirety. This analysis is processed via a proprietary mathematical algorithm, weighting each factor to a different
          contributing portion to generate the final, 6-antigen/antibody classifier. This test is interpreted as a whole, not via the individual reactivities.
          The dynamic capability also allows for the acquisition of information over time to watch biology change.
          <br>
          <br>
          The SLE-key® test results areinterpreted in a binary fashion, with results below the cutoff threshold excluding the diagnosis of SLE (Ruled Out) with
          a Sensitivity of 94%,Specificity of 75%, and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 93% in the validation study (See “Explanation of Statistics” below
          for further detail).

          The SLE-key® SLE Rule-Out Test was developed on ImmunArray’s SLE iCHIP® printed with 200 different antigens. Classification was performed using a
          standard widely used approach with a training set of 300 patients (150 SLE/150 healthy controls [HC]), a verification set of 100 patients (50 SLE/50
          HC) and a final validation set of 100 patients (50 SLE/50 HC). This classification method achieved a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 75%, with
          a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 93% to Rule Out SLE. All samples utilized were from patient sera. SLE patients were obtained from previously
          acquired, banked frozen samples. HC samples were both obtained both prospectively under IRB-approved protocols, as well as a minority of samples
          obtained from previously acquired banked frozen samples.
